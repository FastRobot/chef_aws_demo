# sampleApp

This cookbook deploys our sample application to a single instance.

It uses poise to stand the app up in a concise and pleasant format.

The actual CounterService sinatra app is bundled in this cookbook, which we normally
wouldn't encourage (use a git sub-resource in the application resource!) but we included
it for the sake of simplicity.
